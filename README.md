# PlaylistCreator
PlaylistCreator is the classical one-trick pony: Creates playlists - no more, no less.
Originally developed from oddgravity, now released to the general public.

Be aware that the codebase is rather old and uses C++ with MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes). As for the IDE Visual Studio 2008 was used.

So if somebody wants to pick up development I would recommend to do a rewrite in a modern language. My choice would have been C# with WPF but I never found the spare time to do this.

Cheers
Michael
