# PlaylistCreator
PlaylistCreator from oddgravity released to the general public.

Be aware that the codebase is rather old and uses C++ with MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes).
So if somebody wants to pick up development I would recommend to do a rewrite in a modern language.

My choice would have been C# with WPF but I never found the spare time to do this.

Cheers
Michael
