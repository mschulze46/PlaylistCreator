Basic installation
====================================

To install the UAC plugin in your NSIS setup, you just need to copy two files from the above ZIP:
  * For ANSI installers, copy UAC.nsh into your Include directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\NSIS\Include)
    and UAC.dll from Release/A into your Plugins directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\NSIS\Plugins).
  * For Unicode installers, copy UAC.nsh into your Include directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\NSIS\Unicode\Include)
    and UAC.dll from Release/U into your Plugins directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\NSIS\Unicode\Plugins).
