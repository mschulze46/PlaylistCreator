                <a name="chapter1"></a><strong>Creation of a playlist</strong><br><br>
                At first add all desired files to the playlist. Now select a save location for the playlist. At last enter
                the name of the playlist and select its type. Clicking on the button "Create Playlist" will then create the
                playlist.<br><br><br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <a name="chapter2"></a><strong>Adding entries to a playlist</strong><br><br>
                There are different ways for adding entries to a playlist: Click on the button "Add folder" to add the
                content of a complete folder or click on the button "Add files" to add one or more files to the playlist.
                If you want to add the content of an already existing playlist then click on the button "Add playlist"
                and select the desired playlist.<br><br>

                Folders, files and playlists can also be added to the playlist via drag and drop from Windows Explorer.
                Please note that playlists can only be added via single-selection drag and drop.<br><br>

                The selected files will only be added to the playlist if the corresponding file type is in the list of active
                file types (Settings >> File Types). A short example: The folder you want to add contains MP3- and OGG-files.
                Your list of active file types contains the 'MP3' but not the 'OGG' file type. If you add this folder to the
                playlist all MP3-files will be added to the playlist, all OGG-files won't be added.<br><br><br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <a name="chapter3"></a><strong>Open or insert existing playlist files</strong><br><br>
                There are two methods for importing the content of an existing playlist file: Open a playlist file or insert
                a playlist file.<br><br>

                Opening a playlist file means, that the current playlist is discarded and the content of the opened playlist
                is inserted. Furthermore the save location, the name and the type of the playlist is automatically initialized
                with the opened playlist. So if an existing playlist file should be modified then opening the playlist file
                is the way to go.<br><br>

                Playlist files can be opened in two different ways: Either click on the toolbar button "Open" and select the
                desired playlist file or drag and drop a single playlist file from Windows Explorer onto Playlist Creator and
                afterwards click on the button "Open".<br><br>

                Inserting a playlist file means, that the content of the inserted playlist is added to the current playlist at the
                selected position. So the current playlist is not discarded but it is complemented with the inserted playlist.
                The save location, the name and the type of the current playlist are not changed, either.<br><br>

                Playlist files can be inserted in two different ways, too: Either click on the button "Add playlist" and select the
                desired playlist file or drag and drop a single playlist file from Windows Explorer onto Playlist Creator and
                afterwards click on the button "Insert".<br><br><br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <a name="chapter4"></a><strong>Recursively adding folders to a playlist</strong><br><br>
                Folders can be added recursively (i.e. content of the folder and all subfolders) to the playlist either via drag
                and drop from Windows Explorer or via the "Add folder" button.<br><br>

                To add folders recursively via drag and drop, just hold the "Ctrl" key pressed while dropping the accordant folder
                onto the playlist. Certainly, you can also drop several folders and/or files onto the playlist at once and add them
                recursively.<br><br>

                If you want to add a folder recursively via the "Add folder" button, you only have to select the checkbox
                "Add folder recursively", which is located directly below the display of the currently selected folder, in the
                folder selection dialog and click on 'Ok'.<br><br><br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <a name="chapter5"></a><strong>Changing the order of playlist entries</strong><br><br>
                Select the items that you want to move and click on the button "Move up" or "Move down". You can also move
                the selected playlist items by using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Arrow Up" for moving the items one position
                up or press "Ctrl + Arrow Down" for moving the items one position down. The same functionality is available via
                the context menu of the playlist. Right-clicking on the selected entries pops up the context menu where you can
                select the desired action.<br><br>

                Furthermore it's possible to move the selected items to the beginning or the end of the list. This works
                by analogy with the above explanations via the accordant button, keyboard shortcut or context menu action.<br><br>

                The selection of multiple items works exactly like in Windows Explorer: Just click on the items with pressed
                "Shift" or "Ctrl" key.<br><br><br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <a name="chapter6"></a><strong>Removing entries from a playlist</strong><br><br>
                Either click on the button "Remove selected items" to remove the currently selected items from the playlist or
                click on the button "Remove all items" to remove all items from the playlist. Furthermore you can delete the selected
                items with the shortcut "Ctrl + Del". Use the shortcut "Ctrl + Shift + Del" to remove all items from the playlist.
                Another way for removing items from the playlist is using the context menu of the playlist. Right-clicking on the
                playlist or the selected items pops up the context menu where you can select the desired action.<br><br>

                All these operations just remove the concerning entries from the playlist. Of course no files will be deleted from
                your hard disk!<br><br>

                The selection of multiple items works exactly like in Windows Explorer: Just click on the items with pressed
                "Shift" or "Ctrl" key.<br><br><br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <a name="chapter7"></a><strong>Creation of dynamic titles</strong><br><br>
                To activate the creation of dynamic titles open the "Extended Information" page in the settings and activate the check boxes
                "Write extended information" and "Readout data from tags". Now you can specify the desired title format directly below.
                At the right side of the dialog you'll find a list of all available title variables.<br><br>

                Note: Dynamic titles can only be created from file types which support tags (metadata). This includes for example file types
                such as MP3, OGG and WMA.<br><br><br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <a name="chapter8"></a><strong>Adding custom file types</strong><br><br>
                Open the "File Types" page in the settings. Enter the desired file type on the right side and click on the
                "New" button. The file type you entered will now be added to the list of inactive file types. To activate
                this type immediately just select it and click on the "Add" button.<br><br><br>
              </li>
