            The name of the program says it all - with Playlist Creator you can create playlists easily and quickly.
            The composition and creation of a playlist is done within seconds: Just add all desired files, enter the
            name of the playlist and select its save location and one moment later your first playlist is already done!
            By the way, the fastest and easiest method for adding files to the playlist is via drag and drop from
            Windows Explorer.<br><br>

            Playlist Creator supports the powerful open-source library <a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">MediaInfo</a>.
            Thus a reliable readout of tags (metadata) of numerous file formats in combination with a very high processing speed is guaranteed.
            The user can choose whether the program should readout tags and which data exactly should be extracted. Furthermore you
            can create dynamic titles using simple variables.<br><br>

            You can add files of any file type to the playlist. After installation of the program you'll find many
            predefined file types. If the desired file type is missing you can easily add this type to the list.<br><br>

            For compatibility with a wide variety of hardware and software Playlist Creator can create playlists either in
            PLS-format or M3U-format.
